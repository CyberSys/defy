# Defy

The world-first open-source GTA-like open-world game focused on freedom of customization and modding.

## Motivation

The most modified open-world games are the GTA series, but they are closed-source and proprietary which limits the modding and customization.

Beyond technical limitations, there's legal insecurity on modding projects that can be takedown by the game companies.

The goal of this project is to make the best open-source GTA-like open-world game of the world that bring security to modding and customization.

## Why Godot?

The Godot engine allows you to save a lot of time in development because of the node system, where the relationship between the game components is very easily and fast to implement things.

Also because of GDScript, the Godot scripting language allows you to write less code to implement things.
